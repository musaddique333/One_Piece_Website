                    <p class="summary">Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[10]
                        is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well
                        as the most powerful of its top fighters.[26][27] He desires to find the legendary treasure left
                        behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,[28] which would help
                        facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and
                        crew.[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the
                        world.[31]</p>

                    <p class="summary">Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the
                        Revolutionary Army,[32] and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[33] where their
                        family carries the initial of D. At age 7, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which
                        turned his body into rubber.[34] Shanks also gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become
                        Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet
                        again someday after he became a great pirate.[35] Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of
                        Curly Dadan,[36] Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D.

                        Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during
                        his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants
                        of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio".[23][24]
                        His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made
                        to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.[25]</p>
